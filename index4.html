                Nice to meet you, and thanks for checking out my page. My name is David Schriesheim, and I’m from Chicago, Illinois. My hometown of the Windy City has played a large in shaping who I am today. My favorite food is deep-dish pizza, and my favorite sports teams are the cubs, bears, blackhawks, and bulls.
                Throughout high-school and the beginning of college I was a competitive swimmer, taking up most of my time. The spare time I had was mainly spent on sleeping, eating, or playing video games. After graduating college with a sociology major and political science minor, I moved to LA, where I’m currently working for Bird, the last-mile electric scooter sharing vehicle transportation company."
